Fragmentation model
Files:
• Fragmentation model main.R;
• Tree-structure generator.R;
• Generate synthetic data.R;
• Gibbs sampler for the inference.R;
• Masses prediction.R;
• Test of fragmentation model with real data.R.
Instructions:
• Run Fragmentation model main.R 
Output:
• Expected values of the masses of fragments and related confidence interval, given
synthetic data.
Remarks:
• User inputs can be modified at the beginning of the routine Fragmentation model
main.R;
• The average execution time of this routine is 4 minutes;
• The routine Test of fragmentation model with real data.R provides the expected
values of the masses of fragments and related confidence interval, given the set
of real data coming from the ATV 1 re-entry observation campaign.

AHP model
File:
• AHP model main.R
Instructions:
• Run AHP model main.R selecting it from File ! Source file....
Output:
• Generate the plot Failureprobabilities.pdf, depicting the probabilities for the failure
to occur in a sequence of events, given pairwise comparisons from experts
and observations.
Remarks:
• Experts judgements can be modified at the beginning of the routine.
